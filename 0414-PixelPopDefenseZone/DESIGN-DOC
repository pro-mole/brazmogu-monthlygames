PIXEL POP DEFENSE ZONE[Working Title]

===========
  Concept
===========

Defend a circular zone from the relentless attack of mysterious pixels with the aid of your mighty mouse pointer!

============
  Gameplay
============

The game begins displaying the safe zone in the middle of the square screen. At regular intervals, a pixel of random color(ranging from an array of discrete colors) will appear anywhere near the border of the screen, and start moving towards the center. The number, speed and frequency of the pixels raises slowly as the game progresses.

To achieve points and avoid defeat, the player must click a pixel to destroy it. If the pixel touches the zone, the game ends and the score is tallied.

If the player clicks on pixels of the same color in a row, the mouse pointer will gain a "destruction radius" that destroys pixels around the clicked point, with the radius increasing as the chain raises. For the purposes of checking color chain, only the pixel that was clicked counts to the chain.

Flashing pixels will cause all pixels of the same color on the screen to be destroyed. For the purposes of checking color chain, only the color of the flashing pixel that was clicked counts. Clicking a flashing pixel of a different color will cause the chain to reset.

Hollow pixels will add an extra layer of protection to the zone, so if a pixel reaches the center the player will not lose at once. Hollow pixels also count towards color chain checking.
