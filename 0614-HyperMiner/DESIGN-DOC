HYPERMINER

===========
  Concept
===========

A gravity based puzzler flavored around interplanetary and deep-space mining operations.

============
  Gameplay
============

The player controls a mining probe launched in the deep vastness of space. The probe has limited control at first, but as the player progresses it can achieve better capabilities through upgrades.

=============
  The Probe
=============

The probe is a spherical vessel of negligible mass equipped with modules to aid in its task of interplanetary mining.

Default Modules:
 - Engine: provides fine propulsion for manuevering. Consumes Fuel.
 - Reaction Wheel: provides torque for spinning and stabilization. Consumes Energy.
 - Booster: provides a burst of propulsion for launch and sudden acceleratoin. Consumes Booster Fuel.
 - Drill: extracts minerals from the body to the Storage Crates. Consumes Energy and Fuel.

Additional Modules:
 - Pump: extracts liquids from the body to the Storage Tank. Consumes Energy and Fuel.
 - Vacuum Chamber: extracts gases from the body's atmosphere. Has to be emptied to be used again. Consumes Energy and Fuel.
 - Radar: maps the universe around the probe. Consumes Energy.
 - Sensor Probe: used to gather info on the body. Consumable.
 - Life Support: used to carry life-forms(temporary upgrades).
 - Solar Panel: used to recharge energy when near stars.
 - Fuel Still: used to produce fuel without the help of a Station. Consumes energy.

  Physics Simulation
======================

In an ideal simulation, all bodies would be free and the universe's gravity pulls would regulate themselves nicely. This is not an ideal simulation, of course.

For simplicity purposes, objects are not subject to general gravity, only the gravity of objects in a class bigger or equal than itself. The classes and their mass ranges(in log2) thus are:

CLASS 0 - The Probe - 0
CLASS 1 - Space Stations, Satellites - [1,4] (15)
CLASS 2 - Asteroids, Comets - [4,6] (~50)
CLASS 3 - Natural Satellites - [7,8] (~250)
CLASS 4 - Planets - [9,12] (~3,500)
CLASS 5 - Stars - [15,18] (~20,000)
CLASS 6 - Black Holes - INFINITY
 
(Black Holes may not actually exist, but if they do, they are a big deal, yes)
 
In summary: the probe is affected gravitationally by everything, but it won't affect things like, say, planets or stars with its itty bitty gravitational pull. And, most important, we won't have Stars moving around accidentally because they are pulled by the planets they orbit. Just a matter of making navigation easier, yes.

===================
  Parametrization
===================

In short: defining a set of parameters by which our universal constants will be reverse engineered.

- The probe size is 4. It should be small enough to look fine when docked on the space station.
- The space stations are about the size of an average moon, but much lighter.
- The probe should undock from the space station easily.
- A planetary system(planet, moons) should fit about one screen(excepting cases of way too many moons)
- A solar system shouldn't be wider than 10 screens(about 5 each size of of the star)

=======================
  Universe Generation
=======================

The easiest and most intuitive way of going with the random generation of our univere would be to start with the biggest stuff around: stars.

Generate each star and define the "maximum radius of planet influence". That would be the point in which gravity becomes negligible. This is the size of the stellar system for this star. Every star system should not overlap with each other.

Next, generate everything that orbits the star itself. Comets, asteroids, planets. Place them in defined orbits and define initial velocity.

For each planet, generate satellites, natural and artificial. Define their composition(rocky or gas giant) and what they can have, depending on distnace from their sun.

Space stations should be stationed either around planets or satellites(or even, slow asteroids).

Then throw the probe from a station, and there we go.

=====================
  Material Exchange
=====================

Upon docking with a space station, the material exchange UI is activated. Here the player can exchange material in stock for upgrades, refills or just dump material away for points(yep, let's make it a score game for the demo)
