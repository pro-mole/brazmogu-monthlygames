==PROTO-DESIGN (from Evernote)==

A simplified version of the "Colonization Chess" game, made in Stencyl 3. Because we might as well try, yes?

Starting with one tile in the middle of opposite sides of the board, each player has a limited number of actions per turn(starting at three) that can be used to:

- Spread to neutral tiles
- Fortify conquered tiles
- Attack enemy tiles

Players can only affect their tiles and tiles adjacent to their territory

Tiles can be of different types:

- Norrmal Tile: Nothing to see here, folks.
- Base Tile(Hexagon): The initial tile of each player. Taking control of it ends the game.
- Resource Tile(Diamond): Provides extra actions per turn, depending on the level.
- Density Tile(Square): Provides one extra defense point to each addition to a conquered tile, depending on the level.
- Focus Tile(Triangle): Causes one extra damage on each attack to enemy tiles, depending on level.
        Tile types are denoted by a geometric symbol. Tile levels are denoted by the number of shapes in the tile.

Teams:
- Plantae (vegetable look)
- Urban (civilized look)
- Virus (biohazard look)
- Nano (technological look)
